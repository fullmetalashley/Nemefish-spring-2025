You: Oof. My back!
//<<pose PC_STANDING_STRETCHING>>
-> You were up early, Theodore. At least, I assume that was you thumping up and down the tent all night.
    <<jump Thumping>>
-> How're you feeling this morning, Theodore? I was worried about you last night!
    <<jump Worried>>

Theodore: The urge to run, a craving for blood, the overwhelming need to knead human flesh into biscuits—
If you had <i>my</i> cerebellum instead of your frontal lobe, you might enjoy the same urges.
-> Well, that's some pretty colorful language first thing in the—

//<<pose PC_STANDING_FORWARD_SURPRISED>>
-> Good grief, Theodore! You speak!
Theodore: Yes, I speak.
<<wait .2>>
If you keep making that face, it might stay that way. A laugh for me—but for you... well, maybe it wouldn't change much.
//<<pose PC_STANDING_FORWARD_NEUTRAL>>
-> But how?! When?!

Theodore: Half-past three? There I was, innocently dreaming of hot, quaking throats when—all of a sudden—I awoke to a knot of thick, human words in my skull. Blech. <i>However</i> do you manage to think around them? 
-> It must have something to do with that strange glow last night...
Theodore: Perhaps. But, to be honest, I'd rather we didn't make a big thing out of it.
-> "Don't make a big thing out of it"?! Theodore, you <i>talk</i> now.
    <<jump YouTalk>>
-> If that's what you really want...

-> Well, if you need any pointers on putting your foot in your mouth, just ask, Theodore.

Theodore: And about my name... It's Whiskers, actually.
-> What? But every time I said Theodore, you——
Whiskers: Corrected you, yes.
-> Huh. Whiskers. Well, it doesn't quite inspire fear, does it?
    <<jump InspireFear>>
-> Whiskers. <i>Whiskers</i>. Yeah, okay. I can see you being a Whiskers.

Whiskers: Take it up with my mother, oaf. Hmph. Whiskers is a perfectly respectable name—downright terrifying in certain circles. Ask a rat.

Whiskers: I make no such promises. But I am listening... which is more than you usually get from a cat.
-> Okay. Well. I've always wondered, but now I guess I can just put it to you. Do you still... I mean, did you ever...

    Whiskers: Who couldn't? Now, let's be off. It's time to get my white paws <i>bloody</i>.

<<else>>
    Whiskers: You know, if you'd asked me <i>before</i> we got to this God-forsaken rock, you might've received a more flattering answer. Seeing as things are, is it not enough that I'm staying by your side?
    -> I guess I deserved that. Love you too, buddy.
    Whiskers: Now, let's be off. It's time to get my white paws <i>bloody</i>.
