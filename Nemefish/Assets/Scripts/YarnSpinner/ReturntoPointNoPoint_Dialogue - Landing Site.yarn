Are you ready to return to Point-No-Point Dock?
-> WE'RE READY.
    We're ready to collect our reward.

        Whiskers: Aren't you forgetting something?
            You: What?
                Whiskers: The first half of our payment!

title: QuickQuestion
---
Whiskers: Quick question. This will be our first time around other humans with my... new verbal skills. 
You: And?
Whiskers: Well, do you think me speaking in... <i>mixed company</i> is wise?
-> BE POLITE.
    I suppose it's up to you.
    <<jump Up2You>>
-> MOVE THINGS ALONG.
    Perhaps it's better that we keep your new ability between us for now. 
    <<jump BetweenUs>>
-> DIG DEEPER.
    Of course! If a talking F.O.H.I. is the strangest thing someone's seen in this day and age, they've been living in la la land, not the Swallowed Strait. In fact, Whiskers, I insist you don't hide what you're capable of.

title: Up2You

Whiskers: If it's all the same to you then, I'd prefer staying "mum" for now.
You: I understand. You never liked people falling all over you.
Whiskers: Indeed. Sends me sprinting for the closet every time.
You: So. It's settled. Just let me know if you change your mind.

title: BetweenUs

Whiskers: I'm relieved you agree. I don't like being the center of attention. I far prefer being ignored.
You: To be fair, it can make you pretty needy.
Whiskers: Oh, please. I simply take advantage of the humans' distraction to enact my revenge, that is all.
You: Well, I'm glad it's settled. Just let me know if you change your mind.

title: LaLaLand

Whiskers: I was afraid you'd say so. I suppose it's the curse of a feline—to be an object of worship when you'd far prefer a life in the shadows.
You: I know you're nervous, Whiskers, but I think what's happened to you is connected to what's happening to the Swallowed Strait—possibly all the Drowned Coast.
Whiskers: Nervous? <i>Nervous</i>? Mortified, perhaps. Indignant, absolutely, but I am not a nervous little <i>kitten</i>.
You: Well, I'm glad that's settled. You're doing the right thing, Whiskers.
Whiskers: No wonder I feel terrible.

    We'd better stay and find it.

    I can't stand this island another second. Let's go.
