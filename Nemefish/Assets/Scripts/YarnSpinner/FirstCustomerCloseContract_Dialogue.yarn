Customer: They live on a derelict cruise ship—the Mother Superior. Eccentric folk, mostly harmless. But around here? Well, some Drowners think they're a cult. I was worried that if you knew they were my source of information, you'd write me off. Plenty would.
-> DIG DEEPER.
    So you risked lives for your <i>reputation?</i>

    A floating cult? Now I've heard everything.

<<pose FirstCustomerCrying>>
Customer: Not for my reputation. For my family. Every day I watch the tide inch closer to my home. By the time my youngest is four, it'll be flooded. Still—no matter how much we scrimp and save—we've never had enough to leave. Then, it hit me: Dismal Notch! Thanks to the shark with legs, land there is cheap. But we needed the shark with legs gone in order to relocate.
You: I can't say I would've done what you did, but I suppose I now understand why. 
Customer: Thank you, friend. That's all I ask.
-> MOVE THINGS ALONG.
    So, your aunt. She's part of a cult?

Whiskers: Please: don't lump me in with the riff raff.
Customer: Oh, of course. Apologies. Gosh. My kids will think I'm spinning a yarn...
