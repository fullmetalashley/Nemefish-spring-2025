You: Oof. My poor back.
<<pose PCSittingStretching>>

You'd an early morning, Theodore. Least, I assume that was you thumping up and down the tent while I was trying to get some shut eye.
Theodore: A quickening of blood, a pinch at the nape, the impulse to knead a lump of flesh into biscuits—
If you had <i>my</i> cerebellum instead of your frontal lobe, you might enjoy the same urges.
-> POKE SOME FUN.
    Blood? <i>Biscuits?</i> How about we try getting a full night's rest before getting all—
-> BE POLITE.
    Whoa, there. That's some pretty colorful language for first thing in the—
<<pose PCSittingSurprised>>
Good grief, Theodore! You speak!
Theodore: Yes, I speak.
<<wait .5>>
If you keep making that face, it might stay that way. A laugh for me—but for you... well, maybe it wouldn't change much.
<<pose PCSitting>>
You: But when did this happen? <i>How?</i>
<<jump ButHow>>

Theodore: I'd guess around half-past three? There I was, innocently dreaming of hot, quaking throats when—all of a sudden—I awoke to a knot of thick, human words in my skull. Blech. How do you manage to think around them? 
You: It must have something to do with that strange glow last night...
Theodore: Perhaps. But, to be honest, I'd rather we didn't make a big thing of it.
-> DIG DEEPER.
    But what if the same thing happens to me?!
    <<jump HappensToMe>>
-> MOVE THINGS ALONG.
    God, my head is scrambled. Okay, sure. If that's what you want, we won't discuss it.
    <<jump WontDiscuss>>

Theodore: Gasp! What a thought! Do you think you'd finally speak properly or somehow blab even more?
-> MOVE THINGS ALONG.
    Harhar. Alright I'll drop it.

Theodore: Thanks. To be honest, I think I may need a moment. To adjust.
-> MOVE THINGS ALONG.
    Well, if you need any pointers on putting your foot in your mouth, just ask, Theodore.

Theodore: About that... It's Whiskers, actually.
You: What? But every time I said Theodore, you——
Whiskers: Corrected you, yes.
-> POKE SOME FUN.
    Huh. Whiskers. Well, it doesn't quite inspire fear, does it?
    <<jump InspireFear>>
-> BE POLITE.
    Whiskers. <i>Whiskers</i>. Yeah, okay. I can see you being a Whiskers.

Whiskers: Take it up with my mother, oaf. *Humph* You know, Whiskers is actually a very respectable name. Furthermore—in many circles—it's considered quite <i>terrifying.</i> Ask a rat.
-> MOVE THINGS ALONG.
    Alright, alright. What do I know?

Whiskers: So could my mother, evidently. Anyway, it's an old family name, you know. The whole line of toms. 
-> MOVE THINGS ALONG.
    I guess you learn something new every day.

    Say, uh, Whiskers. If I ask a question, can you promise not to laugh?

Whiskers: Laugh? I haven't tried yet.
<<pose FOHISittingHissing>>
<<wait .2>>
<<pose FOHISittingNeutral>>
Whiskers: <i>*Cough* *Cough*</i> No. That's not how it's supposed to sound. <i>So?</i> Ask away.
-> DIG EVEN DEEPER.
    Okay. Well. I've always wondered, but now I guess I can just put it to you. Do you still... I mean, did you ever...

Whiskers: Come on, spit it out! We have a nemefish to kill.

Whiskers: Who couldn't? Now, let's be off. It's time to get my white paws <i>bloody</i>.

<<else>>
Whiskers: You know, if you'd asked me <i>before</i> we got to this God-forsaken rock, you might've received a more flattering answer. Seeing as things are, is it not enough that I'm stuck with you?
You: I guess I deserved that. Love you too, buddy.
Whiskers: Now, let's be off. It's time to get my white paws <i>bloody</i>.
